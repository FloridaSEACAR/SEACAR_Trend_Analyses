# SEACAR Trend Analyses

The *SEACAR Trend Analyses* repository contains the analysis scripts used to generate habitat-specific reports. Updated forms of these scripts can be found in the *MA Report Generation/scripts/* sub-folder where they are used to generate **Managed Area Reports** for each Managed Area which include analyses for each habitat (except Oyster - in development).

## Managed Area Reports overview

A [**Managed Area Reports Directory**](https://floridaseacar.github.io/SEACAR_Trend_Analyses/MA%20Report%20Generation/) can be used to easily locate HTML and PDF versions for each Managed Area.

The **Managed Area Reports** are located in the [MA Report Generation/output/Reports/](MA%20Report%20Generation/output/Reports/) sub-folder, in both HTML and PDF formats.

Managed Area Reports contain the following information and visualizations if the habitats are included for a given Managed Area:
* Introduction
  + Threshold filtering
  + Value Qualifiers overview
* Discrete Water Quality / Water Clarity (by parameter)
  + Seasonal Kendall-Tau trend analysis ("*discrete trendplots*")
  + Map of discrete sample locations ("*discrete maps*")
  + Programs contributing data ("*program tables*"):
    - ProgramID
    - N_Data
    - Year Min & Max
  + Overview of value qualifiers by year ("*VQ tables*")
    - Year
    - N_Total (total data for that parameter in that year)
    - N_* (count of data entries with a given VQ in that year)
    - Perc_* (percent of data entries flagged with a given VQ compared to total for that year)
* Continuous Water Quality / Water Clarity (by parameter)
  + Station overview table ("*continuous station table*")
    - ProgramLocationID
    - Years of Data
    - Use in Analysis (*True* or *False*)
    - Parameters measured
  + Map of continuous sites with visual indicators showing if they are used in analysis ("*continuous maps*")
  + Seasonal Kendall-Tau trend analyses:
    - For each station/ProgramLocationID ("*continuous trendplots*")
    - All stations combined for each parameter ("*combined continuous trendplots*")
    - For MAs with lots of continuous stations, the combined trendplots will be combined by ProgramID 
* Submerged Aquatic Vegetation (SAV)
  + [Spatio-temporal sample locations plot](MA%20Report%20Generation/output/SAV-Temporal-Scope-Plots) ("*SAV temporal scope plot*")
  + Map of SAV sample locations ("*SAV maps*")
  + Program Summary tables / program-level overview
    - N_Data, Year Min and Max, Collection method, Number of sample locations
    - Individual tables provided for each program
  + Median Percent Cover species trend plots (Linear Mixed Effects)
    - Plots for all available species with LME trendlines laid upon scatterplots of median percent cover ("*SAV multiplots*")
    - Combined species trendlines with their significance indicated, simplified form of above plot ("*SAV trendplots*")
    - LME Trend Results table provides statistical information behind *SAV multiplots* and *SAV trendplots*
  + Frequency of Occurrence plots ("*SAV barplots*")
  + GAM species plots - Median % Cover ("*SAV GAM plots*")
* Nekton
  + Species richness plots (LME trend analysis)
* Coral
  + Species richness plots (LME trend analysis)
  + Percent cover plots (LME trend analysis)
* Coastal Wetlands
  + Species richness plots (LME trend analysis)
* Oyster (currently unavailable, in development)
