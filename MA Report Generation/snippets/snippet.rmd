# Threshold Filtering

Threshold filters, following the guidance of Florida Department of Environmental Protection's (*FDEP*) Division of Environmental Assessment and Restoration (*DEAR*) are used to exclude specific results values from the SEACAR Analysis. Based on the threshold filters, Quality Assurance / Quality Control (*QAQC*) Flags are inserted into the *SEACAR_QAQCFlagCode* and *SEACAR_QAQC_Description* columns of the export data. The *Include* column indicates whether the *QAQC* Flag will also indicate that data are excluded from analysis. No data are excluded from the data export, but the analysis scripts can use the *Include* column to exclude data (1 to include, 0 to exclude).


```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
cont_threshold_values_df <- thresholds %>% 
  filter(Combined.Table == "Continuous WQ") %>%
  select(Parameter.Name, Units, Low.Threshold, High.Threshold) %>% 
  arrange(Parameter.Name)

kable(cont_threshold_values_df, col.names = c("*Parameter Name*", "*Units*", "*Low Threshold*", "*High Threshold*"), 
      escape = F, caption = "Continuous Water Quality threshold values",
      format = "simple") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "scale_down",
                position = "center")
cat("\n")

```

```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
disc_threshold_values_df <- thresholds %>% 
  filter(Combined.Table == "Discrete WQ") %>%
  select(Parameter.Name, Units, Low.Threshold, High.Threshold) %>% 
  arrange(Parameter.Name)

kable(disc_threshold_values_df, col.names = c("*Parameter Name*", "*Units*", "*Low Threshold*", "*High Threshold*"), 
      escape = F, caption = "Discrete Water Quality threshold values",
      format = "simple") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "scale_down",
                position = "center")
cat("\n")

```

```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Filter for 2Q,4Q,6Q,7Q because those flags are based on thresholds
kable(qaqc_table %>% filter(`SEACAR QAQC Flag Code` %in% c("2Q","4Q","6Q","7Q")), 
      col.names = c("*SEACAR QAQC Description*", "*Include*", "*SEACAR QAQCFlagCode*"),
      escape = F, 
      caption = "Quality Assurance Flags inserted based on threshold checks listed in Table 1 and 2",

# Value Qualifiers

Value qualifier codes included within the data are used to exclude certain results from the analysis. The data are retained in the data export files, but the analysis uses the *Include* column to filter the results.

**STORET and WIN value qualifier codes**

Value qualifier codes from *STORET* and *WIN* data are examined with the database and used to populate the *Include* column in data exports.

```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
vq_df <- data.frame(qual_soruce = c("STORET-WIN", "STORET-WIN", "STORET-WIN", "STORET-WIN"),
                    vq = c("H","J","V","Y"),
                    inc = c(0, 0, 0, 0), 
                    mdl = c(0, 0, 0, 0),
                    desc = c("Value based on field kit determination; results may not be accurate",
                             "Estimated value",
                             "Analyte was detected at or above method detection limit",
                             "Lab analysis from an improperly preserved sample; \ndata may be inaccurate"))

if(report_type=="PDF"){
  vq_df$desc = linebreak(vq_df$desc)
} else {
  vq_df$desc = gsub("\n", "", vq_df$desc)
}

kable(vq_df, col.names = c("*Qualifier Source*", "*Value Qualifier*", "*Include*", "*MDL*", "*Description*"),
      escape = F, 
      caption = "Value Qualifier codes excluded from analysis",
      format = "simple",
      booktabs = T) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "scale_down")

**Discrete Water Quality Value Qualifiers**  

The following value qualifiers are highlighted in the Discrete Water Quality section of this report. An exception is made for **Program 476** - *Charlotte Harbor Estuaries Volunteer Water Quality Monitoring Network* and data flagged with Value Qualifier **H** are included for this program only.

**Systemwide Monitoring Program (SWMP) value qualifier codes**

Value qualifier codes from the *SWMP* continuous program are examined with the database and used to populate the *Include* column in data exports. *SWMP* Qualifier Codes are indicated by *QualifierSource=SWMP*.
